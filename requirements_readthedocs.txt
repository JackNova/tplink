# There is a bug in readthedocs where it always installs the requirements.txt file.
# https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1621#issuecomment-388165551
# This can cause problems as readthedocs also does not seem to be able to install up to date packages.
#
# This is an empty requirements file for it to use instead as a workaround.
